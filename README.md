# text-color-predictor  
I made this to get more familiar with how neural networks work.  
What the program does is randomly pick a color and, based on its training, decides whether white or black text looks better over that color. 
It finally works oh man  
I'll keep updating it for more interaction couse I made the amount of neurons in the hidden layer be changeable. Also maybe add a GUI after I learn how to do that too.  
But I got it to work and that's important. I'm pretty proud.
