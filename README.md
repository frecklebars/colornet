# text-color-predictor  
!!unfinished
I made this to get more familiar with how neural networks work.  
What the program does is randomly pick a color and, based on its training, decides whether white or black text looks better over that color. 
It uses a back propagation algorithm with 3 input nodes, one hidden layer with 3 nodes and one output node
