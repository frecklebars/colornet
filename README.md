# text-color-predictor
((doesn't work yet, I still need to learn more))  
I made this to get more familiar with how neural networks work.  
What the program does is randomly pick a color and, based on its training, decides whether white or black text looks better over that color. 
It uses a back propagation algorithm with 3 input nodes and (at the moment) 1 output node. 
I know giving it only one output node is the reason why it's not yet working but I'll fix that soon.  

P.S.  
BWonRGB was the original name, which was dumb, but I doubt I'm gonna change it. The repo being named text-color-predictor is good enough I guess.
