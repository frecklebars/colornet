# text-color-predictor
((doesn't work yet, I still need to learn more))  
I made this to get more familiar with how neural networks work.  
What the program does is randomly pick a color and, based on its training, decides whether white or black text looks better over that color. 
It uses a back propagation algorithm with 3 input nodes, one hidden layer with 2 nodes and one output node. I wrote it based on what *I think* it should work. Still now working, but I guess it's a slow progress.  
We'll see.

I also made a version using k-nearest neighbors. ~~Still incomplete as I'm sorta sleepy. Will finish later.~~ Discarded that version because of the huge dataset. It's too slow and not worth finishing. Will go on with the BP one.
